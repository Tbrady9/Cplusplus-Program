# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the app and what problem it solved.
This app prompts the user to set the time and then sets two side-by-side clocks that display the 12 hour and 24 hour times.
The user has the option of adding a single second, minute or hour.

# What did you do particularly well?
This was the first project of the C++ semester and came before our lessons on the main principals of OOP.
Despite that, I think that I created a great project that showed good use of some of those principals and
the use of splitting it up into different files to keep the main file as clean as possible.

# Where could you enhance your code?
After completing additional modules in my C++ class, I think the main file can be cleaned up some more.
I also was not able to figure out a clock that ticks in real time while allowing user input. After researching,
I believe that it can be done but there is a need to use advanced processes that I need to study more.

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging and how did yuo overcome this?
The use of multiple files and OOP principals was tricky as it was not covered in our current class yet and I
needed a refresher. I overcame this by going back to previous class materials as well as finding a great video
by CodeBeauty on YouTube that explained the principals very well.
